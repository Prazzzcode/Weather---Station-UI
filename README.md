# Weather---Station-UI
ESP8266 Weather Station – A real-time IoT weather monitoring system using ESP8266 and environmental sensors (DHT22 / BMP280). Displays live temperature, humidity, and pressure data on a web-based dashboard with interactive charts
🌦️ ESP8266 Weather Station

This project is a Wi-Fi enabled Weather Station powered by the ESP8266 microcontroller.
It reads environmental data from sensors and displays:

🌡️ Temperature (°C)

💧 Humidity (%)

⏲️ Pressure (hPa)

All data is displayed in real-time on a clean web dashboard with live charts.

⚡ Features

📡 Wireless data monitoring via ESP8266.

📊 Real-time charts for temperature, humidity, and pressure.

🌐 Web interface accessible from any device on the same network.

🔌 Low-power and suitable for solar/battery operation.

🔧 Compatible with sensors like DHT11, DHT22, BMP280, BME280.
